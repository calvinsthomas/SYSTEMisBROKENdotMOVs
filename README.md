## AI Agentic Pull Request System

This repository now includes an **AI Agentic Pull Request System** that provides automated code analysis and pull request generation. 

### Features

- 🤖 **Automated Analysis**: AI-powered repository scanning for improvements
- 🔒 **Security Scanning**: Detection of potential security issues and exposed secrets  
- 📝 **Smart PR Generation**: Automated pull request creation with detailed analysis
- ⚙️ **Configurable Workflows**: Flexible configuration for different use cases
- 🛡️ **Security-First Design**: No hardcoded credentials, environment-based configuration

### Quick Start

1. **Configure the system**:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   ```

2. **Run the AI agent**:
   ```bash
   ./ai-agent/scripts/run-agent.sh
   ```

3. **Or use the Python implementation directly**:
   ```bash
   python3 ai-agent/scripts/agent.py ai-agent/config/agent-config.yaml
   ```
