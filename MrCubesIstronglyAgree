Yes Mr.Cuban and Steve Ditto, exactly I strongly agree. I am the ultimate end user customer in my own real-time streaming data consumption for any quant strat I build, why can I not access my own "U+1F595'ing" (Unicode - middle finger emoji icon) data I purchase! I tried to purchase highest-quality ground truth dataset from 2000's old school vendor for my pseudobonds strat for $30K and was rejected without any reason (mixed motive). I tried 2 API's (outside prior Databento subs) over nearly 6 months months and cannot extract basic needs there either at $100 per mo. each! Insane Mr.Cuban and I hope you will agree as I am the only customer that matters in quant; as I am the architect of new or orthogonal alphas in the Crypto StatArb spaces!
